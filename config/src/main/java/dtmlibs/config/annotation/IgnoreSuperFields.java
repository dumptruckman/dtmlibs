 * Tells the serializer to ignore fields from any super interfaces/classes and only use the fields declared in the
 * annotated class.
 * <br>
 * If this is present on a parent of a child class it will include the fields of both the parent and child but will not
 * include any from the parent's parent.
 * <br>
 * This may only work when not using a custom serializer for the annotated type.
